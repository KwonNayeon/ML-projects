Introduction
- Collect housing census data every five years.
- I am assisting the preperation for this.

Expectations
- Get work experience (way of working, as a team, in a company)
- So far, I've worked in a university (with thesis adviser, TA experiences, language teaching experiences)
- which data Statistics Korea deal with?
- GIS data

Goals
1. Know me better, my preferences
- What is important in terms of chosing a company to work?
e.g. people, work and life balance, self-improvement, company culture, do I prefer to work as a team?
2. Soft skills
- communication skill
- interpersonal skill
- how to work with people who have different background
3. hard skills
- SQL (managing DB could be challenging in terms of census data)
- Machine learning (self-improvement, e-learning, library)

Challenges
- Everything is new to me (New city, New environment, living alone for the first time, new people, new work place)
- Can I get used to all of those?
- Company culture (government office)

Excitement

Conclusion
- Because of the duty of privacy and security system or something, I can't explain what I do in detail.
- I am going to focus on "take away", "reflection".
- I am so grateful to people who have supported me so far. My mom, friends, and a mentor.
